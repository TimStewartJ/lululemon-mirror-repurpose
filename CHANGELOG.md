# Changelog

## Unreleased

## 1.4.0 - 2026-08-24

- Add a separate boot-persistent Android device-owner OTA supervisor.
- Add HMAC-authenticated LAN update tooling with independent one-time bootstrap
  credentials, monotonic replay protection, and strict upload limits.
- Require the exact device fingerprint, Home package, release certificate,
  increasing version code, and streamed APK SHA-256 before installation.
- Add local known-good APK backup, silent PackageInstaller updates, loopback
  health checks, automatic data-preserving downgrade, and manual rollback.
- Add token recovery and explicit device-owner deprovisioning through
  ADB-forwarded loopback recovery.
- Add deterministic failure-injection builds and hardware-validate install,
  reboot persistence, health failure, automatic rollback, manual rollback, and
  repeat OTA upgrade.

## 1.2.3 - 2026-08-24

- Reconcile camera monitoring immediately when permission is granted externally
  through Android Settings.

## 1.2.2 - 2026-08-24

  after delayed acquisition or automatic camera recovery.

## 1.2.1 - 2026-08-24

- Turn the physical panel backlight completely off during sleep while keeping
  Android, camera monitoring, and network controls active.
- Detect stalled preview frames and camera-service errors, fail open, and retry
  camera acquisition automatically.
- Verify installed APK bytes when legacy ADB omits its success marker, avoiding
  false update and rollback failures.

  APK state unverifiable.

  face recognition, or image upload.

  widget.
